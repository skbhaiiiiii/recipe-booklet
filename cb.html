    <h3>Step by Step Recipe of Chole</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <u>Soak and Boil Chickpeas</u>: If using dried chickpeas, soak them overnight in water. Drain and rinse them the next day. In a muslin cloth, take star anise, cinnamon, black cardamom and some cloves. Tie it in a knot and add it to the pressure cooker with chickpeas. Boil them with a little salt until soft (about 3-4 whistles). If using canned chickpeas, rinse them thoroughly and set aside.</li>
            <li><u>Prepare the Base Masala</u>: In a mixer grinder add onions, tomatoes, ginger, garlic, coconut powder and make a fine paste.</li>
            <li><u>Prepare the Masala</u>: Heat oil or ghee in a large pan. Add mustard seeds, cumin seeds, bay leaves, curry leaves. Once they crackle, add the base masala. Saut√© until the oil starts to separate from the masala.</li>
            <li><u>Add Spices</u>: Add turmeric, red chili powder, coriander powder, chole masala and salt to taste. Cook for another 2 minutes.</li>
            <li><u>Combine with Chickpeas</u>: Add the boiled chickpeas to the pan and mix well. Pour in some water to achieve your desired consistency. Use the same water in which the chick peas were boiled. Let it simmer for 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Garnish with fresh coriander leaves and lemon wedges.</li>

        <li><u>Make the Dough</u>: In a large mixing bowl, combine the all-purpose flour, semolina, sugar, salt. Add the yogurt, oil and mix well. Gradually add water and knead into a smooth, elastic dough. Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for 1-2 hours.</li>
        <li><u>Shape the Bhature</u>: After resting, divide the dough into small balls. Roll each ball into a round or oval shape, about 5-6 inches in diameter.</li>
        <li><u> Fry the Bhature</u>: Heat oil in a deep frying pan. Once the oil is hot, gently slide the rolled dough into the oil. Fry until the Bhature puffs up and turns golden brown on both sides. Remove and drain on paper towels.</li>
